# Noether

> Turn a structural belief about a model into a Lean-checked certificate.

You have an exported model and believe it has a property: information can reach
the sites that need to interact; an XC construction has the required hinge; an
operator is self-adjoint by construction. A test can sample outputs. Noether
turns the architectural claim into a theorem about the exact artifact.

```text
model.pt2 → artifact-grounded structural IR → generated Lean obligations → certificate
```

A certificate is bound to the exported artifact and IR hashes. Lean accepts or
rejects the generated theorem; language models may suggest a proof, but never
decide that it is valid.

Natural-language input follows a separate evidence route: an LLM may draft the
IR, a human edits and confirms the intended specification, and Noether still
generates and verifies Lean proofs. Confirmation selects what to prove; it does
not approve the result.

## Quick start

```bash
make
make test

# Lean proof-search demo
./noether demo physics-toy

# Legacy V1 policy demo
./noether demo dft --scenario certified
```

Start a verifier service when driving it directly:

```bash
./build/proof-search
```

## Common workflows

Run an existing proof-search task set:

```bash
./noether agentic --provider mock --run-dir build/runs/demo < tasks.jsonl
./noether tui --run-dir build/runs/demo
./noether review --run-dir build/runs/demo
```

`tui` shows the live run. `review` is the separate read-only view for accepted
Lean proof patches and verifier diagnostics.

For seven artifact-backed pass/fail examples, use
[Structural V2 demos](STRUCTURAL_V2_DEMOS.md).

## Trust boundary

Noether certifies structural compatibility, not numerical accuracy,
convergence, trained weights, or experimental agreement. Lean checks the
generated theorem, not the PT2 binary itself. Artifact certificates trust the
sandboxed extractor and reviewed Torch-to-IR mapping; specification
certificates trust the human-confirmed interpretation. Both require Lean.

## Current scope

Structural V2 is the primary workflow: it produces reviewable Lean proofs for
artifact-backed structural claims or human-confirmed specifications. Legacy V1
remains available only to reproduce its policy-based prototype results.

A theorem-centric evolution of Structural V2 (`vista verify ...`,
`dftcert/verification/`) inverts which side defines the requirement: a
selected *Lean theorem's* premises are the mathematical requirement, and an
artifact adapter only supplies Lean-instantiable facts to try to satisfy
them. It checks whether artifact-grounded structural facts are sufficient
to establish those selected requirements under explicit interface and
external assumptions -- never that Lean verifies the model itself, and
never that an accepted external assumption has thereby been proven true.
See `VISTA_THEOREM_CENTRIC_CODEX_SPEC.md`. `vista structural` (this
section's workflow above) is unaffected and still the default.
