# Structural V2: real-model workflow

Structural V2 answers a deliberately narrow question: **does this exact model
artifact have the architectural constructions required by the DFT policy?** It
does not evaluate floating-point outputs or claim that trained weights are
physically accurate.

The exact supported Torch patterns and their assumptions are specified in
[the Structural V2 translation specification](../../docs/structural-v2/STRUCTURAL_V2_TRANSLATION_SPEC.md).

## Concrete demo

The bundled `CertifiedRingGNN` has six sites. Its exported graph contains three
matrix multiplications, so information can travel from site 0 to site 3 along
`0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3`. Its XC output uses `relu`, which the V2 policy classifies as
a hinge construction. Its learned operator is returned as `B + B.T`, so
self-adjointness follows from construction rather than from checking numerical
entries.

Three variants each expose one useful failure witness:

| Model | Structural witness |
| --- | --- |
| `TooShallowRingGNN` | depth 2 cannot cover required coupling `0 -> 3` |
| `UnconstrainedOperatorGNN` | direct parameter has no guaranteed adjoint symmetry |
| `SmoothXCGNN` | sigmoid is smooth, not a hinge construction |

## Export with Windows Torch from WSL

The repository can stay in WSL while Windows Python performs only the export.
For this checkout, run:

```bash
/mnt/c/WINDOWS/System32/WindowsPowerShell/v1.0/powershell.exe -NoProfile -Command \
  "Set-Location 'D:\fun stuff\proof_vibe'; py -3 examples\dft\models\export_structural_gnns.py"
```

If `py -3` is not the Torch environment, replace it with the full Windows
Python path. The exporter writes `.pt2` files under
`build/structural-v2-models/`.

Production analysis uses the no-network bubblewrap boundary:

```bash
./vista structural analyze-pt2 build/structural-v2-models/certified-ring.pt2 \
  --constraints examples/dft/structural-v2-input-constraints.json \
  --output build/certified-ring-ir.json
```

When WSL has no Torch, a trusted local demo analysis may also be run with the
Windows Torch environment:

```bash
/mnt/c/WINDOWS/System32/WindowsPowerShell/v1.0/powershell.exe -NoProfile -Command \
  "Set-Location 'D:\fun stuff\proof_vibe'; py -3 examples\dft\models\analyze_structural_gnns.py build\structural-v2-models"
```

That local route is for artifacts you created yourself. Uploaded or untrusted
`.pt2` files must go through bubblewrap.

## Generate and prove the exact obligations

```bash
./vista structural generate --ir build/certified-ring-ir.json --jsonl \
  > build/certified-ring-tasks.jsonl

./vista agentic \
  --provider command \
  --llm-command "python examples/orchestrator/vista_demo_llm.py" \
  --verifier build/proof-search \
  --full-process \
  --small-model \
  --max-epochs 3 \
  --stagnation-epochs 2 \
  --journal-dir build/runs/certified-ring/journal \
  --run-dir build/runs/certified-ring \
  < build/certified-ring-tasks.jsonl \
  > build/certified-ring-proof-results.jsonl
```

`--small-model` shortens context; it does not skip a stage. `--full-process`
forces the decomposer, every configured proposer, critic, Lean verifier, and
reporter to appear in each task trace. Only a Lean `verified` result is accepted
during assembly. Epochs resume the existing search graph; if two consecutive
epochs add no nodes, the task is saved as `paused_stagnant` instead of burning
the remaining local-model budget.

```bash
./vista structural assemble \
  --ir build/certified-ring-ir.json \
  --proof-results build/certified-ring-proof-results.jsonl \
  --source-output build/CertifiedRingCertificate.lean \
  --report-output build/certified-ring-certificate.json

./vista structural check-certificate \
  --project examples/dft/lean \
  --source build/CertifiedRingCertificate.lean \
  --trusted-local
```

## Natural-language alternative

Natural language uses the same IR and Lean generator, but it cannot prove a
claim about a `.pt2` file. The result is labelled
`confirmed_specification`, not `artifact`.

```bash
./vista structural draft-description \
  --description architecture.md \
  --llm-command "your-local-qwen-adapter" \
  --output build/spec-draft.json

# Review proposed_claims in the draft, edit them if necessary, then confirm:
./vista structural confirm-description \
  --draft build/spec-draft.json \
  --reviewed-claims reviewed-claims.json \
  --confirmed \
  --output build/confirmed-spec-ir.json
```

The remaining generation, agent, assembly, and Lean-check commands are the
same. The distinction between a specification certificate and an artifact
certificate is permanent and recorded in the assembly report.

Human confirmation only says that the reviewed IR is the specification the
reviewer intends VISTA to attempt to prove. It does not establish any
structural property. The confirmed IR still generates the same three classes
of Lean obligation, and certificate assembly still requires a Lean-verified
proof result for every generated theorem.

## Direct Qwen comparison

Do not compare systems by how convincing their prose sounds. Run direct Qwen
and Qwen inside VISTA on the same four cases, then store each result as:

```json
{"case":"certified-ring","checks":{"xc_discontinuity_compatible":true,"spatial_nonlocality_compatible":true,"self_adjoint":true},"artifact_sha256":"...","ir_sha256":"...","certificate_status":"verified"}
```

Score both files with:

```bash
python examples/dft/evaluate_structural_v2.py \
  --direct build/direct-qwen-results.json \
  --harness build/vista-qwen-results.json
```

The scorer reports structural answer accuracy separately from artifact-binding
and Lean-verification rates. A direct prompt may match all three answers; it
still has not produced evidence tied to the exact `.pt2` file unless those
separate metrics are also present.
