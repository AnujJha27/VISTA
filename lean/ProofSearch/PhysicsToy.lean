Small physics-flavored Lean targets for VISTA demos.

These are intentionally dependency-light and bundled with the repository. They
are not meant to be a physics library. Their job is to give the orchestrator
real-looking theorem statements with stable targets, binder contexts, products,
records, and rewrite/constructor structure.
